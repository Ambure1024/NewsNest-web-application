ðŸ“° NewsNest â€“ A Modern News Aggregator Web App
NewsNest is a dynamic and responsive news aggregator web application built during my internship at BrainlyHood Technologies. It fetches and displays real-time news articles across multiple categories using a third-party news API.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Frontend:
React.js (Component-based architecture)
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Bootstrap (for responsive UI)

Backend:
Node.js (used for server interaction / future extensibility)
Other Tools:
React Router (for navigation)
News API (for fetching real-time data)

ðŸ”„ Workflow & Features
Navbar (Component)
A responsive navigation bar (NavBar.js) with a hamburger toggle on smaller screens. It allows users to filter news by category like:

Business
Entertainment
Health
Science
Sports
Technology
News Feed (Dynamic Cards)

Each article is represented as a card (NewsItem.js) with:
Title, description, image
Author, published date
Source badge (category-specific colored badge)
External link to full article
Loading Spinner (UX Enhancement)
Displays a loading GIF (Spinner.js) while data is being fetched, ensuring a smooth user experience
